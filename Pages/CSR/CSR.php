        <p class="grounded-para">
          I’ve been fortunate to learn from good teachers, coaches, and mentors. Over time,
          I’ve realised that learning becomes more meaningful when it is shared. The small
          opportunities I’ve had to help others have shaped me just as much as my academic
          and sports journey. These experiences remind me to stay grounded, grateful, and
          aware of the responsibility that comes with access to education and technology.

        <p class="grounded-mini">– A Small but Meaningful Moment</p>

        <p class="grounded-para">
          On my way to classes, I once met a 10th-grade girl working at a small tea cart.
          She came from a Telugu-speaking family and found English difficult because she
          didn’t have much support to practice it. I had a set of books with me, and I
          decided to give them to her so she could read and improve her confidence.
        </p>

        <p class="grounded-para">
          It was a small gesture, but it reminded me how access to the right resources can
          change someone’s learning journey.

      They were smart, eager to learn, and just needed access to the right tools.

          I teach Grade 10 Mathematics at my tuition, because I enjoy breaking down concepts
          in a simple way. Seeing someone move from confusion to clarity is very satisfying.
          Teaching has also helped me strengthen my own fundamentals and become more patient
          while explaining ideas.
