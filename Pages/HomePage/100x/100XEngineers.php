      <p>
        After launching Vet Bookr and completing my 10th grade exams, I wanted to build stronger foundations in AI and real-world engineering. I joined the 100X Engineers Cohort, a cohort-based learning experience where motivated learners build real AI applications and gain hands-on experience in GenAI, APIs, full-stack frameworks, and applied machine intelligence.

      <p>
        What makes this especially meaningful is that many of my cohort classmates are senior professionals from various industries who chose this program to future-proof their careers with AI knowledge and practical skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        I joined this program at 16, where the average age was significantly higher, which pushed me to learn faster, communicate effectively, and contribute confidently among experienced peers.
      </p>

      <p>
        This has become one of my most important learning foundations in building meaningful AI tools and gaining a head start in a rapidly evolving tech world.
