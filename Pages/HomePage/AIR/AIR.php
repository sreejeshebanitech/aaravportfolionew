        <h2 class="radio-title">All India Radio Interview <br> – A Special Moment</h2>
        <p>
          I had the opportunity to give my first live interview on All India Radio, one of India’s most widely listened-to radio networks. During the interview, I spoke about my coding journey, building Vet Bookr, my passion for badminton, and how I balanced everything alongside academics. It was a new and exciting experience to share my story with a larger audience.

          I learned how important it is to communicate clearly and honestly. What meant the most to me was when the host mentioned that my journey could inspire other students listening - that moment truly stayed with me.
