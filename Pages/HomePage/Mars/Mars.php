        Mars International – Invitation & Recommendation
      </h2>

      <p class="mars-text">
        After PETEX, I was invited to present Vet Bookr to the technology and innovation leaders at Mars International, a global leader in pet care products and services. I explained the idea, walked them through the product, and discussed how it could evolve.
      </p>

      <p class="mars-text">
        I was humbled to receive a Letter of Recommendation from Mars International's Head of Digital Commerce. It was an affirmation of the work I had done and a major confidence boost early in my tech journey.
