          PETEX is one of India’s largest pet lifestyle and products exhibitions, bringing together brands,
          service providers, and pet parents under one roof.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had the chance to showcase Vet Bookr at PETEX, where I demoed the app to more than 30 pet product
          and service stakeholders, and post the event I visited pet-friendly cafes and stores, and also gathered
          communities to meet with pet parents to showcase Vet Bookr and get their feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          The response was encouraging: many people and brands expressed interest in partnerships, feedback, and
          future collaboration. That experience taught me a lot about real-world product validation and listening
          to user needs.
