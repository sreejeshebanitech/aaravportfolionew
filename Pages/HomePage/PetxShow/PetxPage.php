        <p>
          PETEX is one of India’s largest pet lifestyle and products exhibitions, bringing together brands,
          service providers, and pet parents under one roof.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had the chance to showcase Vet Bookr at PETEX, where I demoed the app to more than 30 pet product
          and service stakeholders, and post the event I visited pet-friendly cafes and stores, and also gathered
          communities to meet with pet parents to showcase Vet Bookr and get their feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          The response was encouraging: many people and brands expressed interest in partnerships, feedback, and
          future collaboration. That experience taught me a lot about real-world product validation and listening
          to user needs.

            <p class="journey-description">
              Building Vet Bookr was more than just creating an app; it was my first real experience of turning an idea into a live product. It taught me how technology, problem-solving, and persistence come together when building for real users.
            </p>

            <div class="journey-phases">
              <p><strong>The Need Analysis</strong> – I researched existing apps solving similar problems and studied their features to identify gaps and improvements.</p>
              
              <p><strong>The Ideation to Development Phase</strong> – From naming the app to designing it as a single-stop solution for pet parents, I built it for both Android and iOS using Flutter, ensuring the front end and back end worked smoothly together.</p>
              
              <p><strong>The Go Live Phase</strong> – Android went live without major challenges, but the iOS launch was tougher. It pushed me to fine-tune small details, which I’m grateful for.</p>
              
              <p><strong>The Marketing Phase</strong> – I was nervous initially, but I gained confidence over time and began enjoying the journey. The encouragement I received strengthened my belief in what I had built.</p>
