      <h2>SPORTS JOURNEY</h2>

      <p class="sports-description">
        Sports have been one of the strongest foundations in my life. Long before achievements and medals, they taught me discipline, consistency, and how to handle both wins and setbacks. Training early in the mornings, competing under pressure, and balancing academics alongside intense practice shaped not just my physical strength, but my mindset. My sports journey has played a big role in building the focus and resilience I carry into every other part of my life.

              Falling in love with badminton at a young age, I trained under
              national and international coaches, competed at state and
              national levels, and developed grit, discipline, and passion
              that shaped my character.

              Through four years of disciplined training, I became a state
              and national gold medalist in powerlifting, setting records
              and proving to myself that strength is built through focus,
              patience, and relentless consistency.
