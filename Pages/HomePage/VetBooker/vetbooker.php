            <h3>The Problem That Started It</h3>
            <p>
                When I moved to Singapore, our pet’s vaccination and
                health records were difficult to retrieve. That experience
                revealed a broader challenge most pet parents face:
                managing scattered health information.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 15, I designed and deployed <strong>Vet Bookr</strong>,
                a mobile app that allows pet parents to manage
                health records, track vaccinations, find nearby services,
                and connect with other pet owners.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app launched on both Android and iOS, crossing
                150+ downloads in the first week purely through organic
                adoption.
