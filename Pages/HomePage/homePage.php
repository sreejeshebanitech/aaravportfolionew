            <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Aarav.</p>

            <p>
                I've always been curious about how things work  whether it's 
                the code behind an app, how a machine learning model makes 
                decisions, or why consistent effort changes outcomes in sports 
                and life.
            </p>

            <p>
                That curiosity became commitment. I started coding at 13, 
                alongside professional sports training. Today, I focus on AI, 
                data science, product thinking, and business to build 
                solutions that solve real-world problems.
