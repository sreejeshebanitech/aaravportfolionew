        <p>
          While training seriously for badminton, I had to work a lot on strength and conditioning since badminton is one of the fastest racquet sports and demands constant movement and explosive power. My fitness trainer suggested I try powerlifting because it would build strength without affecting my agility.
        </p>

        <p>
          I began training for competitions, mainly to improve my athletic performance. To my surprise, I went on to win gold medals at both state and national levels, and even set a new state record. What started as support training became a competitive journey of its own

        <h3>What Powerlifting Taught Me</h3>
        <p>
          Powerlifting taught me patience and focus. Every lift requires preparation,
          control, and belief in your training. Progress doesn’t happen overnight —
          it’s built slowly through consistency and discipline.
