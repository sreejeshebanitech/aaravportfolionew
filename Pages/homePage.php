                <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm Aarav.</p>
                <p>
                    I've always been curious about how things work, whether it's the code behind an app, 
                    how a machine learning model makes decisions, or why consistent effort changes outcomes 
                    in sports and life. That curiosity gradually became a commitment: I started coding 
                    when I was 13, and I began professional sports training around the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, both technology and athletics shaped how I think, act, and understand 
                    challenges. Today, I'm focused on learning AI, data science, product thinking, and 
                    business, because I want to build tools that actually solve real problems.
